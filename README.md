This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Development server

Make sure that the backend server is properly running along with the database (instructions available on the backend repo). Once that is done, this app is hardcoded to request at `http://localhost:8080` for the backend.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Installation

To run this application, be sure to have `node.js` installed. Then run

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then, navigate to the root of this repository and run

```
npm install
```

Finally, run the app using `ng serve`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
